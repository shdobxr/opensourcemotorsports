Hey Guys, apologies for the downtime however there was a bit of hussle around the holidays. With swapping out the blogging software, to sourcing parts, getting gifts for family members. It's been hard to find time to turn a wrench. That said no complaints, just wanted to bring the site back to life with more material.

Was going to use Nikola, for the static webhosting, but found hugo and surge. And that is enough for me to get this up and running. 

Will be bringing back some of those parts and lists to follow on posts. To include a "data" area where I can share specific elements of my build for the betterment of any other s2k modder out there.

Cheers,

DG
