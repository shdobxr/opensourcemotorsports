I just won't say anything about 2020. We all got the t-shirt and membership to
a "party" we all didn't ask for.

For those in the DC Metro area, I sourced my engine from these guys.

The engine came in pretty good shape, friendly customer service and they even shipped
local to me in local NOVA. Awesome customer service, and will be definitely working
with them in the future for sourcing used s2000 parts if needed.

Up next is getting the motor mounted to the stand, and frankly I may do a video
on that since getting the motor I want to perform a "cold" leakdown test.

I know the numbers will not be close to a warm leakdown, this is more for looking
for pressure uniformity with the engine at a cold state. If something is wrong
with the motor this will help diagnose that ahead of time.

Also a shoutout to Urge Designs (https://urgedesigns.com/) for making the billet rear hubs.
If you wanted some quality custom pieces to get designed, these are the guys to talk
to. They are known for their parts, and the quality of them.

Urge's customer support was top notch, I knew where the part was and heck they
even wanted feedback on how the part performed. While I am not really ready to
test them out, I will be sure to let them know once Addie is back in K form.

Many folks on the k group on facebook have asked for the swap parts list. Soon I
will be able to catalog those parts, and start pulling the motor out.

Before doing that, I want to take Addie for a spin as the final time with the
f20c is near.

Future updates will leverage youtube for speed and ease of blogging.
