Hey folks, been working on getting the site a bit more crisp. And I have an update to the progress with the car.

I have ordered a RockStar Garage (RSG) roll bar. If you are in the market for anything pertaining to your S2k. Look no further than Justin Taylor. Justin has been in the scene for quite sometime. He is honest, and always willing to help with information. He truly seems to try and put his best foot forward in dealing with just the s2k crowd. We don't know how many other customers of other car types he has. I reached out to JT, and he reassured me that the piece is being fabbed up and will be shipped out. This was compiled with the movement of RSG to a new shop. Which is great to hear, as hard work should be rewarded. 

That said in prep for the roll bar coming in. I made the decision to "open" the car up. In that, I am going to be permanently removing the soft top.

A big shout out to <a href="https://www.s2ki.com/forums/members/floppy-82330/"> Floppy</a> from this write up.

While I could potentially just be like a bull in a chinashop, these directions are clear. And to be honest the level of effort for "Floppy" to go through the arduous task of not only taking pictures, but doing his best to capture the steps. 

While I didn't follow them exactly, the softtop in my case is going to be permanently removed. Yes.... cause trackcar.

Here are some shots of my car:

I will warn anyone that things this to be a trivial task. It's not. Make sure you clear out your day of honey-do lists, and make sure you have plenty of light, and a collector system setup for all of the pieces that you are going to collect on your way. 

The soft top is out, and FWIW I am selling the top if folks want it. I have already placed the rear glass on facebook marketplace to see if it gets any attention. Who knows. May just throw a refreshed soft top on it. Then park it in storage if I ever wanted to make the car "stockish" again. 

I plan on selling the 152+k mile F20c motor and Ap1 trans as a whole unit. I had picked up a slightly used AP2 trans from these fine folks. <a href="https://leecparts.com/"> LeeC Parts, Inc. </a> They were even nice enough to give us a tour of their facility. It was like being a kid in a candy store. Please do look them up in your in the NOVA/MD area. 

So with the purchase of the AP2 transmission, I also picked up an AP2 diff, driveshaft and the half shafts to go along with it. This way once I swap in the kmotor it will have AP2 bits to push all of that angry 2.4 vtec through.

Since this post is mainly about getting the site up and running. I wanted to see about if folks were interested in me starting a youtube channel. It would provide some realtime visibility of the build process. While I cannot promise an update frequency to that of a real no kidding blogger. I do plan on driving home more effort on this as this is something of a goal of mine.
